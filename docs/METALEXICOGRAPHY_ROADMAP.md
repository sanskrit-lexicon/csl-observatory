# Metalexicography roadmap — measuring digital-edition richness

**Version**: 1.0 · **Date**: 2026-05-16 · **Owner**: M. Gasūns + Claude Code
**Companion to**: [`LEXICOGRAPHY_ROADMAP.md`](LEXICOGRAPHY_ROADMAP.md), [`L0_DESIGN.md`](L0_DESIGN.md)

This doc plans the measurement of **what each digital edition adds, omits, encodes, and exposes** — distinct from the historical comparison of source contents. It's the meta-layer: the dictionaries-as-software story.

It addresses three large questions:

1. **Are all 35 digital editions equally rich?** No. Quantify the differences.
2. **Has MW received disproportionate attention** in the last 30 years? Prove with markup-richness data.
3. **What features did CDSL ADD** that weren't in the printed originals? Inventory and quantify them.

This stream produces material for **Paper M §4.1.6** (data-richness as KPI), **Paper L §6** (digital edition vs print), and a possible new **Paper E** (engineering/edition) covering the digital-edition history of CDSL.

---

## 1. The data richness typology (10 levels)

A scaled framework. Each digital edition can be placed on this scale.

| Level | Name | What's required | Example dicts at this level |
|---|---|---|---|
| **L0** | **Scan-only** | PDF page images; no text content | Patel-2016 scan-only set (PD, PE, PGN, IEG, MWE, AE, SNP, YAT) |
| **L1** | **Plain text** | OCR'd or keyboarded UTF-8; no markup | early state of all dicts before triage |
| **L2** | **Entry boundaries** | `<L>NNNN` … `<LEND>` markers separate entries | most dicts at minimum |
| **L3** | **Headword / body separation** | `<k1>` for primary, `<k2>` for variants | most well-processed dicts |
| **L4** | **Lexical metadata tags** | `<lex>` (category), `<gen>` (gender) | MW, AP, AP90, PWG, … |
| **L5** | **Citation tagging** | `<ls>` for literary sources, structured | MW (gold), PWG (gold), AP (good), others (partial) |
| **L6** | **Sense structure** | numbered or hierarchical senses; `<sense n="1">` or equivalent | MW (full), PWG (good), most others (partial) |
| **L7** | **Cross-reference tagging** | entry-to-entry pointers as machine-readable links | MW (full), few others |
| **L8** | **Scan-page linking** | each entry → page image of original print | major modern push (Dictionary-to-Book) — MW most complete |
| **L9** | **Cross-dictionary integration** | each headword → corresponding entries in other CDSL dicts | nascent; alternateheadwords, csl-lslink |
| **L10** | **Full structured semantic web** | TEI Lex-0 / RDF triples; queryable; LOD-published | aspirational; not yet achieved by any CDSL dict |

**Hypothesis**: MW is the only dict at L8+; most others sit at L4-L6; specialised ones at L3-L5; scan-only ones at L0.

This typology becomes a **single ordinal metric per dict** (the *richness level*) and **multiple component metrics** (presence/absence per feature).

## 2. Measurable richness dimensions (~30 KPIs)

Per-dictionary, computed from source XML.

### 2.1 Markup density
| KPI | Method | Why it matters |
|---|---|---|
| Distinct tag count | count `<X>` distinct tag names | richer schema = more semantic distinctions |
| Total tag count | count all `<X>` occurrences | depth of encoding work |
| Tags per entry (mean, median) | total tags / entry count | per-entry markup investment |
| Max tag depth | max nesting level | hierarchical structure presence |
| Tag/text ratio | tag chars / total chars | how "structured" vs "prose" the data is |

### 2.2 Semantic tag presence (binary per dict)
| Tag family | Presence indicates |
|---|---|
| `<lex>` | lexical category encoded |
| `<gen>` | grammatical gender encoded |
| `<num>` | number encoded |
| `<ls>` | literary source citations machine-readable |
| `<ab>` | abbreviation expansions encoded |
| `{#…#}` | SLP1 boundaries marked |
| `{%…%}` | display-italic semantics preserved |
| `<k1>`/`<k2>` | primary/variant headword distinction |
| `<sense>` or numbering | sense structure machine-readable |
| `<bookref>` (or equivalent) | scan-page linking present |
| `<dictlink>` (or equivalent) | cross-dictionary linking present |

### 2.3 Citation richness (the truncation insight, applied at edition level)
| KPI | Method |
|---|---|
| Mean citation depth (text→book→chapter→verse) | parse `<ls>` content, measure components |
| Citation completeness | % of `<ls>` with full hierarchy vs truncated |
| Distinct cited works | count unique text-name strings in `<ls>` content |
| Citation density (per entry) | total `<ls>` / entry count |

### 2.4 Cross-reference richness
| KPI | Method |
|---|---|
| Internal references per entry | count `<k1>` recurrences inside body of other entries |
| External/dict references | count refs that point to other CDSL dicts |
| Bidirectional link count | refs that resolve in both directions |

### 2.5 Print-source linking (the CDSL-added feature)
| KPI | Method |
|---|---|
| Print-page coverage % | % of entries with `<page>` or `<bookref>` to scan |
| Image-link presence | % of entries linked to scan image |
| Pagination granularity | per-page, per-column, per-entry |

### 2.6 Editorial overlay (corrections after digitisation)
| KPI | Method |
|---|---|
| Correction issues filed | count from GitHub issues per dict |
| Correction issues resolved | closed-issue count |
| Editorial notes (`<note>`, `<corr>`) embedded in XML | count tags |
| Patel-fingerprint normalisation conformance | how close to Patel's standard? |

### 2.7 Metadata completeness
| KPI | Method |
|---|---|
| CITATION.cff present + complete | check schema fields |
| README richness | char count + section count |
| Schema/DTD documentation | presence of formal schema file |
| API exposure | does csl-apidev expose this dict? |
| App exposure | does csl-app surface this dict? |

## 3. The "MW gets all the attention" hypothesis

**Claim**: Monier-Williams (MW, 1899) has received disproportionate digital-edition attention in the last 30 years.

**Operationalisation** (multiple converging evidence streams):

| Evidence stream | Metric | How to measure |
|---|---|---|
| Markup richness | richness level (L0-L10) per dict | from §1 typology |
| Per-entry markup density | tags per entry (mean) | from §2.1 |
| Citation linking completeness | % of `<ls>` with full text→verse | from §2.3 |
| Cross-reference density | refs per entry | from §2.4 |
| Print-page link coverage % | from §2.5 |
| GitHub issue volume | issues opened (lifetime, normalised by entry count) | from observatory snapshots |
| Commit volume | commits (lifetime, normalised by entry count) | from observatory snapshots |
| Contributor count | distinct contributors per dict | from observatory snapshots |
| Multiple-edition presence | does MW have multiple parallel digital editions in CDSL? | yes: MW72 + MW(1899) + MWS variants |
| Downstream surface area | # of CDSL tools that consume this dict | csl-apidev, csl-app, csl-inflect, csl-devanagari, alternateheadwords, etc. |
| Citation in other CDSL repos | count cross-repo references | grep |

**Visualisation**: a single radar chart per dict on these axes. MW's polygon should dominate. If it doesn't, we revise the hypothesis.

**Counter-hypothesis to test**: maybe PWG or PWK has equal or greater digital investment, just less visible. Worth showing in the same chart.

## 4. CDSL-added features inventory (post-print enhancements)

The user's insight: "We are adding features, like Dictionary to Book links, that were not present in the original dictionary."

### 4.1 Catalogue of added features

| Feature | What it does | When added | Coverage |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Dictionary→Book linking** | Entry → scan page of printed source | ongoing 2014-now | uneven (MW high, others lower) |
| **Cross-dictionary lookup** | Same lemma → entries in other CDSL dicts | ongoing | partial via alternateheadwords |
| **Devanagari rendering at runtime** | SLP1 → Devanagari display | mature | universal via csl-devanagari |
| **Inflected-form lookup** | Surface forms → lemma | partial | csl-inflect (MW only mostly) |
| **API access** | RESTful query over all dicts | mature | csl-apidev |
| **Mobile/desktop app** | Native UI surfacing dicts | newer | csl-app (Flutter) |
| **Search across dicts** | One query → many results | mature | csl-websanlexicon (web), csl-app (mobile) |
| **Per-issue correction workflow** | Track + fix errors via GitHub issues | mature, formalised by runbook | universal across 35 dicts |
| **Roundtrip-encoding validation** | SLP1 ↔ IAST ↔ Devanagari | partial | implemented for some dicts |
| **JSON export** | Machine-readable dict export | mature | csl-json |
| **SQLite distribution** | Compiled queryable DB | mature | csl-sqlite |
| **Stardict / Babylon export** | Conversion for offline dict apps | mature | cologne-stardict |
| **Lemma normalisation index** | Patel-style normalised headword index | new | hwnorm1, hwnorm2 |
| **Headword variant index** | All known spelling variants per lemma | new | alternateheadwords |
| **Literary-source link resolver** | `<ls>` → external scan of cited text | new | csl-lslink |
| **Atharvaveda / Rigveda hymn pages** | Display individual hymns linked from dict citations | new | avlinks, rvlinks |
| **Pipeline DAG** | Orchestrated data-flow for builds | mature | csl-pywork |
| **Tooling-runbook** | Standardised issue taxonomy across all repos | new (2026, this project) | universal |
| **Live observatory** | Cross-repo metrics dashboard | new (this project) | csl-observatory |

### 4.2 Per-dict feature coverage matrix

35 dicts × ~20 features = a presence/absence matrix. Compute coverage % per dict and per feature.

**Expected patterns**:
- MW = highest feature coverage (everything)
- PWG/PWK/MD/AP = high coverage (most features)
- Specialised dicts = lower (scope-limited)
- Russian dicts (KNA, KOW) = currently lowest (recent additions, less integrated)

This becomes a heatmap chart on the dashboard.

## 5. Roadmap for data-structure evolution

**Where we are**: most dicts at L4-L6; MW at L8.
**Where we want to be**: all dicts at L8+ minimum; flagship dicts at L9-L10.

### 5.1 Target end-state (5-year horizon)

For every CDSL dictionary:

- [ ] **L8 minimum**: every entry linked to scan page
- [ ] **L9 stretch**: cross-dict linking active for every shared lemma
- [ ] **L10 aspirational**: TEI Lex-0 export available; queryable via SPARQL

### 5.2 Per-level uplift recipes

| From → To | Required work | Effort estimate |
|---|---|---|
| L0 → L1 | OCR or keyboard the text | weeks per dict |
| L1 → L2 | Add `<L>NNNN` boundaries via regex on source | hours per dict |
| L2 → L3 | Identify and tag `<k1>` and `<k2>` headwords | days per dict |
| L3 → L4 | Tag lexical categories (often present in source as abbreviations like `m.`, `f.`, `n.`) | days |
| L4 → L5 | Identify literary-source citations and wrap in `<ls>` | weeks |
| L5 → L6 | Detect and structure senses (often by `1.`, `;`, `2.` patterns) | weeks |
| L6 → L7 | Detect cross-references and mark | days-weeks |
| L7 → L8 | Match each entry to scan-page coordinates | months (MW already done) |
| L8 → L9 | Build cross-dict lemma matching | new infrastructure |
| L9 → L10 | TEI Lex-0 conversion + SPARQL endpoint | new infrastructure |

### 5.3 Recommended priority by dict family

1. **First wave** (already at L7-L8): finish L8 for AP, AP90, PWG, PWK
2. **Second wave** (at L4-L6): bring SCH, CCS, CAE, MD, WIL, BHS up to L7
3. **Third wave** (at L2-L4): bring specialised dicts (VEI, INM, MCI) to L5
4. **Fourth wave** (at L0-L1): ingest scan-only dicts (PD, MWE, etc.) and bring to L3

### 5.4 Engineering investments needed

- **Standard schema**: define a unified TEI Lex-0 profile for CDSL
- **Migration scripts**: per-source-dict converters to the unified schema
- **Validation harness**: continuous integration that flags schema violations
- **Cross-dict link infrastructure**: new tooling for L9 (extending alternateheadwords + csl-lslink)
- **SPARQL endpoint**: new infrastructure for L10
- **Editorial UI**: more accessible than git+text for non-engineer contributors

## 6. Hypothesis: KOW = Russian translation of WIL

**Claim** (M.G. domain knowledge): KOW (Kossowich, ~1854) is a Russian translation/adaptation of WIL (Wilson, 1832).

**Temporal plausibility**: WIL 1832 → KOW ~1854 = 22-year gap. Plausible.

### 6.1 Convergent evidence to gather

| Evidence | Method | Strength |
|---|---|---|
| Lemma-set Jaccard (WIL ∩ KOW) | set comparison after Patel normalisation | strong if >0.95 |
| Lemma-set order preservation | per-letter ordering | medium |
| Sense-count parallelism | for shared lemmas, do KOW glosses match WIL sense-count? | strong if matches |
| Translation correspondence | machine-translate WIL English → Russian, compare to KOW Russian | strong if >0.7 cosine |
| Citation set similarity (language-neutral) | compare `<ls>` sets | medium |
| Citation order preservation | `<ls>` sequence per entry | strong if matches |
| Forensic typo / OCR-error sharing | rare cross-dict error pairs | strongest if found |
| Page-correspondence | KOW's page numbering related to WIL's? | medium |
| Editorial preface evidence | does KOW preface mention Wilson? | check Cologne scan |

### 6.2 Phase L1.5 (KOW⇄WIL focused study)

A targeted mini-study to test the WIL→KOW hypothesis:
1. Parse both dicts to lemma → glosses → citations
2. Compute the 8 evidence metrics above
3. Bayesian combine into single posterior P(WIL → KOW | evidence)
4. Publish: dashboard chart + paper paragraph in Paper L §6
5. If confirmed: KOW becomes the test-case for cross-language inheritance methodology — applicable to other unknown pairs (e.g. is BUR a French translation of any specific source?)

**Output**: `data/wil_kow_evidence.csv` + a side-by-side display widget on the dashboard.

## 7. The "MW gets all the attention" study (parallel to L0)

A specific cross-cutting analysis using all the metalexicography KPIs from §2-§4.

### 7.1 Charts to produce

1. **Single radar chart per dict** with normalised KPIs (markup density, citation richness, cross-ref count, Dictionary-to-Book coverage, downstream surface area). MW's polygon should encompass others.
2. **30-year attention timeline** for MW vs PWG vs AP: commits + issues per year, side-by-side
3. **Feature coverage heatmap**: 35 dicts × 20 added-by-CDSL features
4. **Investment-equivalent chart**: each dict's volunteer-hours estimate (from Phase A) divided by entry count → "minutes invested per entry"

### 7.2 Expected paper findings

- MW's per-entry investment is 5-10× the median dict
- MW is the ONLY dict at L8 (full Dictionary→Book linking)
- MW has the deepest XML markup
- MW is referenced in the most other CDSL repos
- BUT: PWG has comparable per-entry investment when normalised (it's foundational)

This becomes the **opening paragraph of Paper L §6** — empirically substantiating an oft-stated but never-quantified claim.

## 8. Implementation phases (added to lexicography stream)

| Phase | Name | Effort | Output |
|---|---|---|---|
| **L0** | Convention fingerprint cladogram | ~5d | first phylogenetic tree (already designed) |
| **L1.5** | KOW⇄WIL focused study | ~3d | proof of WIL→KOW + cross-language methodology validation |
| **M1** | Data-richness typology assignment | ~3d | every dict placed on L0-L10 scale |
| **M2** | Markup density KPIs | ~3d | the 30 KPIs in §2 |
| **M3** | "MW gets all the attention" study | ~2d | radar charts + investment timeline |
| **M4** | Added-features inventory matrix | ~2d | 35×20 coverage heatmap |
| **M5** | Data-structure evolution roadmap recommendations per dict | ~3d | actionable per-dict uplift plan |
| **M6** | TEI Lex-0 schema design | ~5d | unified target schema |

Total metalexicography stream: ~21 days (3 weeks active work, spread across 6 months).

## 10. Open questions for next round

1. **Schema reference**: should we adopt **TEI Lex-0** as the canonical target schema for CDSL (L10)? Or develop a custom CDSL schema first, then map?
2. **L8 reference dict**: is MW genuinely at L8, or partially? What's the % of MW entries with full Dictionary→Book linkage as of today?
3. **Russian dicts (KNA, KOW)**: do they currently have any markup beyond plain text, or are they at L1?
4. **Feature inventory completeness**: are there any major CDSL features I missed in §4.1? Look at https://www.sanskrit-lexicon.uni-koeln.de/ frontpage if needed.
5. **WIL→KOW priority**: is this hypothesis strong enough that L1.5 should run BEFORE L0 (as a pilot of cross-language methodology)?
6. **Paper E**: separate paper, or merged into Paper L?
