# Concordance — dimension numbering across schemes

**Purpose**: decouple our **operational** fingerprint numbering (the `dim_1…dim_30`
keys baked into every CSV, script, and tree) from **Dhaval Patel's 2016** convention
numbering (the citable source for conventions 1–7). The pipeline is stable on the
L0 IDs; this file is the only place the mapping to external schemes lives, so Patel's
paper order can be confirmed or revised here **without touching code or data**.

**Companion**: [`fingerprint_conventions.md`](fingerprint_conventions.md) (definitions),
[`../L0_DESIGN.md`](../L0_DESIGN.md) §2 (rationale).

---

## Stability contract

1. **`L0-dim-N` is canonical.** Every `data/L0/*.csv` column (`dim_N_value`,
   `dim_N_source`, `dim_N_confidence`), `dim_schema.json` entry, and script keys on
   the integer N. These IDs are **frozen** — never reused or reordered in place.
2. **Human-facing names/order may change freely** — they live in `dim_schema.json`
   (the `name` field) and in this concordance, not in the column keys.
3. **External numbering (Patel 2016, TEI, OntoLex) is recorded here only.** If Patel's
   paper turns out to order his 7 conventions differently from our `dim_1…dim_7`, we
   update the `Patel2016 §` column below — the fingerprint matrix is unaffected.
4. **Retiring a dimension**: mark it `deprecated` in this table and in `dim_schema.json`;
   do not delete the column or renumber survivors (keeps old trees reproducible).

**Legend.** `Patel2016 §` — the convention's number in Dhaval Patel's 2016 paper;
`✅` = confirmed against the PDF. `—` = a project addition, not in Patel 2016.
`#opts` — option count (see `fingerprint_conventions.md`). `patel2016` status = the
cell is populated from Patel's own per-dict assignments.

## Patel 2016 ⟶ L0 (confirmed 2026-06-03)

Confirmed against `refs/Patel_2016_Normalizing_headwords.pdf`: Patel's conventions
appear in his paper in the **same order** as our `dim_1…dim_7`. The numbering coincides.

| our L0 dim | our short name | Patel 2016 conv. # | Patel's own title | confirmed |
|---:|---|:---:|---|:---:|
| 1 | anusvara-before-cons | 1 | Treatment of anusvāra before consonants | ✅ |
| 2 | r-duplication | 2 | Duplication of consonants after 'r' | ✅ |
| 3 | at-ending | 3 | Treatment of words ending with 'at' | ✅ |
| 4 | inflected-headword | 4 | Uninflected / inflected forms | ✅ |
| 5 | verb-anusvara | 5 | Treatment of anusvāra of verb | ✅ |
| 6 | rkaranta | 6 | Treatment of ṛkārānta words | ✅ |
| 7 | vas-yas-suffix | 7 | Treatment of words ending with vas/yas (kvasu/vasu/īyasun) | ✅ |

## Reserved for future external schemes

When the TEI Lex-0 and OntoLex-Lemon exports land (locked decision, SESSION_HANDOFF
§3), add columns mapping each L0 dim to its TEI element / OntoLex property here, so a
single lookup serves all three serialisations.

## Change log

| Date | Change |
|---|---|
| 2026-06-03 | Concordance created. Adopted `L0-dim-N` as the frozen operational numbering, decoupled from Patel 2016 (recorded here for citation). No code/data renumbered. |
