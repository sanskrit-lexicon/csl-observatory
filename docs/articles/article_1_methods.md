## 3. Methodology

This section describes our four-dimensional KPI framework, the data sources, the volunteer-hour estimation methodology, and the reproducibility guarantees of the open observatory.

### 3.1 The four-dimensional KPI catalog

We organise lexicographic-project measurements into four orthogonal dimensions, each populated with a set of computable KPIs. The four dimensions and their rationale are:

**Activity** — measures *what was done and when*: issues opened, issues closed, commits authored, pull requests reviewed, releases tagged. This is the temporal pulse of the project. Activity KPIs are derivable from any git-hosted project's API metadata; they require no domain knowledge.

**Coverage** — measures *what is included in the lexicographic record*: which lemmata appear in which dictionaries, with what density, with what citation backing. Coverage KPIs require parsing of source XML and a canonical headword index (in our case, the pre-computed `sanhw1.txt` from Cologne's `hwnorm1` repository, which normalises ~470,000 headword variants into a single SLP1 namespace per Patel's (2016) conventions).

**Community** — measures *who contributed, when, and how their work is distributed*: contributor counts, retention curves, geographic distribution, bus-factor concentration, specialisation patterns. Community KPIs require the same git metadata as Activity, augmented by curated identity information (in our case, `data/people.yaml`, generated from project-wide CITATION.cff files).

**Ecosystem** — measures *what depends on or cites the lexicographic record*: web-display traffic (where available), external citations in academic literature, Wikipedia and Wiktionary backlinks, downstream tool consumption (mobile apps, JSON exports, SQLite snapshots). Ecosystem KPIs require ingest from external sources (web analytics, Semantic Scholar API, MediaWiki `exturlusage` endpoints).

Each KPI in our framework is **defined by a tuple** `(name, dimension, data source, computation method, visualisation type, frequency of refresh)`. The full catalogue contains 30+ KPIs across the four dimensions; we provide it as a downloadable CSV at `https://sanskrit-lexicon.github.io/csl-observatory/data/kpi_catalog.csv`. Section 5 (below) applies this framework to CDSL and reports headline findings.

### 3.2 Data sources

Our measurements draw on five categories of source:

1. **GitHub REST and GraphQL APIs** for the `sanskrit-lexicon` organisation (77 repositories, 12 years of history). We fetch issues (state=all), pull requests, commits since 2014, repository metadata, contributors, releases, and language statistics. Full snapshots are archived monthly in our `observatory/snapshots/YYYY-MM/` directory; snapshots are append-only and dated, so any chart can be reproduced from any historical state.

2. **The canonical CDSL master headword index** (`sanhw1.txt`, 469,844 unique normalised SLP1 lemmas across 41 dictionaries). This file is produced and maintained by the Cologne team and applies Patel's (2016) headword normalisation conventions. Use of this pre-computed index spares us the substantial effort of rebuilding lemma overlap matrices from the raw dictionary XML.

3. **Source XML of individual dictionaries** in `csl-orig/v02/<dict>/<dict>.txt`, for entry-level microstructure analysis (subentries, citations, etymology markers, grammatical tags). We process these per-dictionary using regex-based extraction calibrated against a manual annotation of a 10-entry sample.

4. **CITATION.cff files** in each dictionary's GitHub repository, providing authorship + publication-year metadata. We enriched all 34 dictionary-repo CITATION.cff files in May 2026 to include publication years, author lists, and preferred-citation blocks; the enrichment script is `observatory/enrich_citations.py`.

5. **External usage signals**: the Cologne University web analytics (Matomo, when accessible), Wikipedia and Wiktionary `exturlusage` queries across all language editions, and the Semantic Scholar API for academic citation tracking. These are deferred to a later phase (Phase F/G/M0a of the project roadmap) and reported here as future work.

All snapshots, intermediate transformations, and final chart data are version-controlled in the public `csl-observatory` repository and exported as CSV/Parquet from a stable URL namespace under `https://sanskrit-lexicon.github.io/csl-observatory/data/`.

### 3.3 Volunteer-hour estimation

We report a sensitivity range, not a point estimate, for the equivalent monetary value of CDSL volunteer labour. Our method has three steps.

**Step 1: classify each commit by effort class.** We use a heuristic combining commit-message regex, diff size, and file count to assign each commit to one of five effort classes: `trivial` (5-min, e.g. typo fixes), `small` (15-min, single-file edits under 50 lines), `medium` (60-min, multi-file edits with design decisions), `large` (180-min, substantial code or schema changes), `huge` (480-min, major refactors or new pipelines). Classification accuracy was validated against a 100-commit hand-labeled sample (Cohen's κ = TBD).

**Step 2: add issue/PR effort.** Each issue receives 5 minutes of triage time plus 45 minutes of resolution time (if closed). Each PR receives 30 minutes of review time. Comments add 5 minutes each. These per-activity time estimates derive from Beller et al. (2017) and Mockus & Herbsleb (2002).

**Step 3: apply three cost scenarios.** We multiply total estimated hours by three hourly rates:
- **Low**: €45/hour (PhD researcher in Germany, fully-loaded employer cost)
- **Mid**: €80/hour (senior software engineer market rate in Germany)
- **High**: €150/hour (Sanskrit-specialist consulting rate reflecting skill rarity)

The result is a range, e.g. "between €X million and €Y million across 12 years," rather than a single number. We argue this range *understates* the true cost because:
- It excludes unpaid time spent reading issues but not acting (typically 2-3× the acting time in OSS projects).
- It excludes offline correspondence and meetings (substantial in academic projects).
- The Sanskrit-specialist rate is conservative for the rarest skills (no Russian / Tamil / Czech-Sanskrit specialist rate is included).

We disclose all assumptions in a single table (§4.5) so reviewers can adjust the numbers.

### 3.4 Reproducibility

Every published chart is reproducible from public artifacts:

- **Source data** is in our `snapshots/YYYY-MM/` directories, append-only and dated.
- **Transformer code** is in `observatory/transform.py` and related scripts, all GPL-3.0.
- **Chart code** is in our Observable Framework site (`observatory/site/src/*.md`); the source markdown plus the CSV input produces the rendered SVG.
- **Annual data snapshots** are deposited to Zenodo with DOI minting via GitHub-Zenodo integration on release tags.
- **Code is preserved** at Software Heritage via SWH's GitHub crawler.

To reproduce any chart in this paper, the reader retrieves the named snapshot (`snapshot 2026-NN`), runs `python observatory/transform.py`, and rebuilds the site via `observable build` from the `observatory/site/` directory. We provide a Dockerfile that pins all dependencies.

A reader who wishes to extend the framework to a different lexicographic project would (1) configure the GitHub-fetch script for the target organisation, (2) adapt the headword-normalisation step to the project's conventions (or apply Patel's framework if Sanskrit), and (3) re-run the pipeline. The estimated effort to apply our framework to a comparable project (e.g. CDLI for Cuneiform, Perseus for Greek-Latin) is 2-3 weeks.

### 3.5 Inheritance detection: two complementary signals

The framework offers two formally distinct derivation signals. *Lemma overlap* measures **content inheritance**: the directed Jaccard containment of headword sets, computed over Cologne's 469,844-entry normalised SLP1 master index. *Convention fingerprint* measures **editorial register**: a 30-dimensional categorical vector covering sense-numbering style, citation format, etymology marking, grammar conventions, accent preservation, Pāṇinian-sūtra citation, and related features, of which dimensions 1–8 and 16 follow Patel's (2016) transcription schema and the remaining 21 are extracted from the CDSL source `.txt` files by deterministic regex with a per-dimension variance check. A priori, content and style should coincide; in our data they do not.

We compared UPGMA trees from both signals over the 30 dictionaries present in both data sources (the intersection excludes three Russian/kośa dictionaries not yet in `sanhw1`, and two reverse-direction English-Sanskrit dictionaries with no Sanskrit-side lemma signal). Three congruence measures agree. A Mantel test returns Pearson r = 0.223 with permutation p = 0.009 over 999 label-shufflings — significant but weak: convention explains roughly five percent of descent-distance variance. The Robinson-Foulds distance between the two topologies is 52 of a maximum 56, against a label-permutation random baseline of 56 ± 1, meaning only **two of twenty-eight internal clades appear in both trees**. Inversions between the two leaf orderings are 202 of 435, close to the 0.5 random expectation.

The two surviving clades are diagnostic. They are (CAE, CCS) — Cappeller's English (1891) and German (1887) editions of the same work — and (AP, AP90) — Apte's 1890 original and its 1957 revised reissue by the same hand. The pattern is exceptionless in our subset: convention recovers descent **if and only if the relationship is a same-author direct revision**. Wherever a lineage crosses an author, language, or major-re-editing boundary, the two signals diverge — including unambiguous descent such as Wilson → Yates, which carries 91% lemma containment yet places the two dictionaries far apart in convention space. The dictionaries whose position differs most between the trees are the specialised indexes (the Mahābhārata names index INM, Edgerton's Buddhist Hybrid Sanskrit dictionary, and the Puranic indices PUI and MCI: distinctive content, generic formatting) and Monier-Williams 1899, where the reverse holds.

This complementarity is the methodological justification for reporting both signals jointly. Convention-only evidence can be defeated by *convergent minimalism* — two compact bilingual glossaries from unrelated traditions may share a minimal-markup register without sharing material, as Yates (1846, an octavo digest of Wilson) and Stchoupak (1932, a Paris digest of the Petersburg dictionaries) do in our data. Lemma-only evidence says nothing about whether subsequent editors regarded the source as authoritative enough to adopt its house style. Joint agreement on both axes is the strong inheritance claim, and §5.2 reports the small set of dictionary pairs in our corpus that pass it.

All artifacts are released under CC-BY-SA-4.0 at `sanskrit-lexicon.github.io/csl-observatory/data/L0/preview/`; the deterministic extractor and the comparison code are `scripts/L0/s2_fingerprint.py` and `scripts/L0/tanglegram.py`; the full phase-L0 validation protocol (known-edge recovery, leave-one-out, 1000-bootstrap confidence intervals) is documented in `docs/handoffs/ARCHITECTURE.md` and reported in detail in companion Paper L.

**Figure 3.5.** Tanglegram of the convention fingerprint (left tree, UPGMA over a 19-dimension Gower distance with missing-cell handling) and the `sanhw1` lemma-overlap distance (right tree, UPGMA over Jaccard) for the 30 dictionaries present in both data sources. Leaf positions within each tree are planar by construction; connector thickness and colour intensity scale with each dictionary's rank displacement between the two trees, so the largest movers are visually emphasised. Only two internal clades — (CAE, CCS) and (AP, AP90), both same-author direct revisions — appear in both topologies; the remaining twenty-six of twenty-eight differ.

### 3.6 What this framework does NOT measure (limitations)

We are explicit about the boundaries of our methodology:

1. **Editorial quality** is not measured. We count corrections issued and resolved, but we do not assess whether the corrections improved the dictionary; that requires expert review beyond automated metrics.
2. **Linguistic accuracy** is not validated. Our lemma counts assume the published headwords are linguistically correct; errors in the source dictionary propagate to our counts.
3. **Citation appropriateness** is not assessed. We count literary-source citations but do not judge whether they support the gloss provided.
4. **Inter-dictionary derivation** is *suggested* by the framework's two complementary signals — lemma containment and convention fingerprint (§3.5) — but full chronological proof requires the additional analyses described in Papers L and H of our series.
5. **Volunteer-hour estimates** are inherently uncertain (we report a range to acknowledge this) and do not capture the intellectual leadership of long-term maintainers, which exceeds what time-on-task can quantify.

These limitations are mitigated by our open-data approach: any researcher who wishes to substitute different assumptions can do so using our raw snapshots.

## 5. Results: applying the framework to CDSL

We apply the four-dimension KPI framework of §3 to CDSL in four subsections (one per dimension) plus a headline equivalent-volunteer-hour estimate (§5.5). Each subsection's tables and figures are populated incrementally as the underlying data phases complete; the present draft reports only those results whose inputs are in hand. The Activity (§5.1), Community (§5.3), and Ecosystem (§5.4) subsections, and seven of the eight Coverage KPIs (§5.2), draw on Phase A–G data not yet collected and are tracked in the project roadmap (`docs/OBSERVATORY_ROADMAP.md`). One Coverage result — the joint inheritance test introduced in §3.5 — is fully populated and is reported below as §5.2.1.

### 5.2 Coverage

Of the eight Coverage KPIs planned for this subsection — headword count per dictionary, definition density, citation density, intra-dictionary cross-reference networks, print-page digitisation coverage, markup richness, encoding-roundtrip success, and issue-typology evolution — seven await the Phase B microstructure extraction. The single result available now is the joint convention/descent inheritance test introduced in §3.5, reported here as §5.2.1.

#### 5.2.1 Dictionary pairs that pass the joint inheritance test

We define a pair (A, B) to **pass the joint test** if (i) at least one direction of lemma containment between A and B reaches 0.85 in `data/sanhw1_inheritance_edges.csv`, and (ii) the convention Gower distance between A and B falls in the lowest quartile of pairwise convention distances over the 32 L0-subset dictionaries (in our data, conv distance ≤ 0.333; median = 0.444; n = 496 pairs). Twenty-two of the thirty-three published inheritance edges have both endpoints in the L0 subset; of these, **eight pass the joint test** (Table 5.2.1).

The eight joint-passing pairs cluster into the three best-attested lineages of nineteenth-century Sanskrit lexicography. The Wilson tradition contributes WIL → SHS (95.3% containment, convention Gower 0.17) and the related YAT → SHS (89.4% / 0.28) — Shabda-Sagara (1900) inheriting both content and house style from H. H. Wilson's quarto (1832) and W. Yates's octavo digest of it (1846). The Petersburg tradition contributes PWG → PW (93.8% / 0.22) — Böhtlingk and Roth's seven-volume *grosses* Wörterbuch being abridged into Böhtlingk's *kürzere* edition (1879–1889) — together with CCS → PW (94.5% / 0.33) and CAE → PW (88.7% / 0.33) for Cappeller drawing on it. The Cappeller pair CCS → CAE (94.0% / 0.11) — the same author's German (1887) and English (1891) editions of the same work — yields the strongest joint signal in the corpus. The Macdonell → PW (88.7% / 0.22) and Grassmann → MW (87.8% / 0.29) edges close out the eight.

**Table 5.2.1.** Inheritance pairs passing the joint convention/descent test (n = 8 of 22 candidates), sorted by convention Gower distance.

| Pair (A – B) | Best direction | Containment | Conv. Gower | Source year → Inheritor year |
|---|---|---:|---:|---|
| CAE – CCS | CCS → CAE | 0.940 | 0.111 | 1887 → 1891 |
| SHS – WIL | WIL → SHS | 0.953 | 0.167 | 1832 → 1900 |
| PW – PWG  | PWG → PW  | 0.938 | 0.222 | 1855 → 1879 |
| MD – PW   | MD → PW   | 0.887 | 0.222 | 1893 → 1879 |
| SHS – YAT | YAT → SHS | 0.894 | 0.278 | 1846 → 1900 |
| GRA – MW  | GRA → MW  | 0.878 | 0.294 | 1873 → 1899 |
| CCS – PW  | CCS → PW  | 0.945 | 0.333 | 1887 → 1879 |
| CAE – PW  | CAE → PW  | 0.887 | 0.333 | 1891 → 1879 |

The fourteen remaining inheritance edges in the L0 intersection fail the joint test — all because their convention distance, despite demonstrable content inheritance, exceeds the lowest-quartile threshold. The foundational example is **Wilson → Yates (1832 → 1846): 92.6% containment but a convention Gower of 0.44, near the corpus median**. Yates condensed Wilson's quarto into a school octavo and adopted different sense-numbering, citation, and gloss-styling conventions in the process; the lineage is unambiguous but the editorial register diverged at the first generation. Ten of the remaining thirteen failures share a single inheritor: Monier-Williams 1899 (MW72 → MW, BOP → MW, BEN → MW, MD → MW, CAE → MW, PW → MW, PWG → MW, CCS → MW, VEI → MW, STC → MW, all with containment ≥ 0.85 and convention Gower between 0.39 and 0.61). Monier-Williams's published synthesis absorbed material from every available predecessor but standardised it to a distinctive house style — Vedic accent preservation, Pāṇinian-sūtra citation, cognate-language tagging, three-level grammar marking — that none of the source dictionaries used. The result is a systematic high-containment / high-convention-distance asymmetry centred on MW. The remaining three failures are intra-Petersburg asymmetries (GRA → PW, BEN → PWG, BEN → PW), of the same flavour at smaller scale.

Conversely, eight unordered pairs are convention-close (Gower ≤ 0.12, in the bottom one percent of pairwise distances) yet absent from the inheritance edges entirely. They cluster around the indigenous Sanskrit–Sanskrit kośas (VCP–SKD at convention Gower 0.00, VCP–KRM and SKD–KRM both at 0.06), the minimal-markup bilingual glossaries discussed in §3.5 (YAT–STC at 0.06: an 1846 Calcutta digest of Wilson in English and a 1932 Paris digest of the Petersburg dictionaries in French, with no content overlap), and a Petersburg-adjacent cluster (PW–SCH 0.12, PW–INM 0.12). These are precisely the convergent-minimalism cases the joint test is designed to exclude from inheritance claims despite their proximity in convention space.

Eight of twenty-two candidate inheritance pairs — 36% — therefore carry both signals; the remaining fourteen (64%) carry only content inheritance, and a convention-fingerprint inheritance claim made about them would, on these numbers, fail the test. The full ranked table (all 22 pairs with both signals) is released as `data/L0/preview/joint_inheritance_table.csv` and the computation as `scripts/L0/joint_inheritance_table.py`.
