## Abstract

Monier-Williams' *Sanskrit-English Dictionary* (MW, 1899) was built in the shadow of
Böhtlingk & Roth's *Großes Petersburger Wörterbuch* (PWG, 1855–75) and Böhtlingk's
abridgement (PW, 1879–89). *How* it inherited has been asserted but not measured. Using
five language-neutral signals across 43 digitised dictionaries plus a scholar-curated
error list, we show that MW inherited Böhtlingk's **apparatus** — which words to enter,
which texts to cite, how to divide homonyms — but **not** his mechanical errors. Where a
PWG headword is misspelled, MW has the correct form in ~98% of curated cases; MW and PWG
share **zero** documented print errors. The inheritance is of scholarship, not of
typesetting. This resolves the size-confounded "MW absorbed 89–94% of PWG" claim into a
precise, defensible statement and supplies a reusable template for separating
content-descent from error-descent in any corpus of related editions.

## 1. The question

"MW copied Böhtlingk" can mean three different things: (i) MW reproduced the *headword
inventory*; (ii) MW reused the *citation apparatus*; (iii) MW carried over Böhtlingk's
*errors*. Only (iii) — a shared mistake — is decisive proof of copying in classical
stemmatics (the Lachmann common-error principle: a correct reading can be reached
independently, but the same error is near-impossible to invent twice). The three claims
are routinely conflated. We separate them.

## 2. Method — a ladder of language-neutral signals

MW is English; PWG/PW are German. Gloss prose is therefore a weak, cross-lingual channel;
the load is carried by signals that survive translation: headword sets, citations
(`<ls>` tags), and homonym structure. Each signal is calibrated against a **null** of
demonstrably unrelated dictionaries (e.g. BHS — Buddhist Hybrid Sanskrit; the indigenous
Śabdakalpadruma/Vācaspatyam are *excluded* from the citation analysis because they cite
in an untagged indigenous style, not for lack of citations — see
`data/forensic/CITATION_TAGGING.md`).

| signal | what it measures | script |
|---|---|---|
| headword containment, size-corrected (L0.8) | shared inventory, de-confounded | `scripts/L0/s6_content_lift.py` |
| **F1** citation overlap | shared apparatus | `scripts/forensic/f1_citations.py` |
| **F2** homonym-split concordance | shared structure | `scripts/forensic/f2_structure.py` |
| **F3** gloss-length tracking | translation of prose | `scripts/forensic/f3_gloss.py` |
| **F4b** shared-error test | copied *mistakes* | `scripts/forensic/f4b_ahlborn_nulltest.py` |

## 3. What MW inherited — the apparatus

**3.1 Headword inventory.** Raw containment is size-confounded (it is *highest*, 0.94, for
the unrelated tiny BOP, because MW's 194k lemmas trivially contain any small dict's common
core). The size-corrected **rare-lemma containment** — the fraction of a source's *rare*
headwords (document-frequency ≤ k across 41 dicts) recurring in MW — inverts that ranking
and isolates descent: PWG→MW 0.70 (df≤3) / 0.82 (df≤5), PW→MW 0.71, MW72→MW 0.57, against
the unrelated BOP→MW at 0.35. **17,007 headwords occur in only MW and PW** in the entire
corpus (L0.8).

**3.2 Citation apparatus (the strongest signal).** Both traditions tag references with
`<ls>`. MW shares a per-lemma citation **source-Jaccard of 0.16–0.19** with PWG/PW, versus
**0.004–0.017** with unrelated dictionaries — a 10–40× separation. **587 rare exact
references are shared for the *same headword* and occur nowhere else in the corpus**:
e.g. `ullApya → SĀH. 545`, `dAsatA → VEṆĪS. 175`, `granTakAra → VEDĀNTAS. 1`, and 565
exact Harivaṃśa line-numbers (`HARIV. 9529` …). MW further reduces Böhtlingk's full verse
references to a bare sigil **41,552 times** — a directional PWG→MW compression. The method
self-validates: it ranks known same-apparatus pairs at the top (PW/PWKVN 0.87, SCH/PW 0.63,
AP/AP90 0.77) and the nulls at the floor.

**3.3 Homonym structure.** On the discriminative *deep* (3+) homonym splits, MW matches the
Petersburg divisions 64–77% of the time (MW/PWG 65%, MW/PW 64%, MW/MW72 77%) versus ~32–36%
for index-type nulls (INM, PUI, PE); the same-author PW/PWG ceiling is 81.5%. Homonym
division is partly linguistically forced, so this corroborates rather than proves.

## 4. What MW did *not* inherit — the errors

**4.1 The decisive test.** `CORRECTIONS/dictionaries/PWG/ahlborn.txt` is a scholar-curated
list (M. Ahlborn, 2011) of 123 PWG headword spelling errors, several recording MW's form
for the same word. **MW carries the PWG error in 2 of 123 cases (1.6%)** — and both
(`asUya/asUy`, `vara/var`) are root-vs-stem citation conventions, not misspellings, so the
genuine figure is ≈ **0%**. Where PWG erred, MW has the *correct* form (90 cases) or simply
lacks the word (31). Independent of typesetting accidents.

**4.2 The null-test trap.** A naïve corpus null is misleading here: headwords corrected in
*both* a Petersburg dict and MW number 256 against 102.8 expected by chance — a lift of
**2.49** (hypergeometric p ≈ 4×10⁻⁴¹). Taken alone this *looks* like shared errors. It is
not: it is the *same hard words* attracting corrections in both works, with **different**
errors in each — convergence on difficult vocabulary, compounded by editorial coupling
(the Cologne `pwgissues` bundles correct one word across several dictionaries by design).
The direct test (4.1) settles what the null cannot.

**4.3 Corroboration.** MW and PWG share **zero** documented print errors (24 PWG / 122 MW
printchange records; F4a). And MW's English gloss *length* tracks PWG's German no more than
it tracks Apte's independent English (Spearman 0.564 vs 0.576; differential −0.01; F3) — MW
**recomposed** the definitions rather than translating Böhtlingk's prose.

## 5. Discussion

The signals converge on one statement: **MW is a faithful heir of Böhtlingk's scholarship
and an independent typesetting.** It reproduced *what Böhtlingk knew* — the lemma inventory,
the textual loci, the sense divisions — but composed its own English articles and did not
carry over the German edition's mechanical errors. This is the forensic complement to the
Phase-L0 finding that MW absorbed the Petersburg *content* while recoding its *conventions*
(PWG→MW convention bootstrap 0.02 vs formatting-lineage edges 0.70–0.81): a dictionary can
inherit an apparatus wholesale yet share neither its house style nor its errors.

Methodologically, "did X copy Y" should be decomposed into inventory / apparatus / error
descent and tested separately — the apparatus signal (here, very strong) and the error
signal (here, null) need not agree, and their disagreement is the actual historical fact.

## 6. Limits and the one remaining decisive test

The curated error sample is small (123) and weighted toward scan-era artefacts a
separately-keyed MW could not share in any case. The citation result proves shared
*sources/editions*, not yet a shared *mistake*: independent use of the same edition can
match. The airtight upgrade is a shared **erroneous** citation — a verse number wrong
against the actual text, present in both — verifiable against a digital corpus
(Digital Corpus of Sanskrit). That is the deferred Phase F4.

## 7. Reproducibility

All figures regenerate from `scripts/forensic/` (run `parse_cslorig.py --all` first) and
`scripts/L0/s6_content_lift.py`, over `../csl-orig`, `../CORRECTIONS`, `../csl-corrections`,
and the sanhw1 snapshot. Datasets: `data/forensic/{citation_pair_overlap,
shared_rare_citations, homonym_concordance, ahlborn_mw_comparison, shared_corrections}.csv`
and the `f*_report.json` files; `data/L0/content_lift.csv`. Per-run provenance in the
`.source.json` sidecars.
