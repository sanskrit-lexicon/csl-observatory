**Russian-language target**: 5 articles (33%).
**English-language target**: 10 articles (66%).
**Mixed publication count**: ~9 in Scopus/WoS, ~6 in Russian peer-reviewed.

**New (2026-05-31) — standalone methods paper**: *Anchoring on Sanskrit: deterministic cross-language sense alignment* (outline → [PAPER_SENSE_ALIGNMENT.md](PAPER_SENSE_ALIGNMENT.md)). Spun out of the R2 sense-splitter work; its empirical core — H1 (granularity is a tradition trait, not temporal), H2 (citation density predicts sense survival), H3 (derivatives copy/condense; Śabda-Sāgara reproduces Wilson **82% word-identical**) — see [R2_FINDINGS.md](R2_FINDINGS.md). Directly supplies evidence for **articles 3** (stemmatics WIL→SHS) and **9** (microstructure). Target: a short DH / computational-lexicography venue (~2027), EN.

### 1.2 Pre-requisite chain

Each article requires data from earlier phases. The dependency graph:

```
Phase A (Volunteer-hours)            → Article 1
Phase L0 (Convention cladogram)      → Articles 1, 3
Phase L2 (Lemma cladogram, sanhw1)   → Articles 2, 3 [DONE in part]
Phase L0.5 (Nirukta deep-dive)       → Article 4
Phase L1.5 (KOW⇄WIL study)           → Article 11
Phase L4 (Per-family analysis)       → Articles 2, 6
Phase M1 (Data-richness typology)    → Articles 7, 8
Phase M3-Bopp                        → Article 5 (MW-Bopp dependence test)
Phase L0.6 (Subentry analysis)       → Article 9
Phase L (compound coverage)          → Article 10
Phase F (Wikipedia backlinks)        → Article 12
Phase L9 (Specialized dicts)         → Article 13
KCH ingestion + L1.5+                → Articles 14, 15 + Dictionary

Phase P (Preface analysis)           → Articles 3, 5 (lineage ground-truth)

Book = synthesis of all 15 articles
Manual = practical extraction from research findings
Dictionary = end product of methodology applied
```

### 1.3 Strategic considerations

**Journal choice rationale:**
- **DSH, IJDL, D-Lib**: top DH / lexicography venues; methodologically focused
- **Indo-Iranian Journal, JAOS, WZKS, BSOAS**: prestigious Indological journals
- **Voprosy yazykoznaniya, Vestnik IVRAN, Vostok, Indoiranskie issledovaniya**: Russian flagship venues

**Article-pair pattern**: each year has one international (EN) + one Russian (RU) where possible, building both English citation footprint AND Russian academic-system credit.

**Authorship strategy** (per CONTRIBUTING.md):
- M. Gasūns first author on all 15 (primary intellectual lead)
- funderburkjim, drdhaval2785 as co-authors on data-foundation papers (1, 2, 3)
- Domain-specialist co-authors per topic:
  - Russian-tradition articles (4, 6, 11, 14, 15): Russian Sanskritist co-author
  - Compound article (10): IIT Hyderabad Sanskrit team
  - Bibliographic / citation network article (12): bibliometrics expert
- Claude (with appropriate disclosure) listed as methodological-assistant on each

**Velocity**: 1.5 articles per year average. Achievable with the data infrastructure now in place.

## 4. The Sanskrit-Russian dictionary (the end-product)

### 4.1 Vision

A quantitatively-grounded, corpus-based Sanskrit-Russian dictionary that supersedes Kochergina 1978 with:

- **~50,000 headwords** (vs KCH's ~30k — a 1.7× expansion)
- Per-headword **frequency** from a Sanskrit corpus (GRETIL, DCS, Sanskrit Heritage)
- Per-meaning **citations** from a curated corpus
- **Russian translations** validated against the existing Russian Indology tradition (KOW 1854, KNA 1893, KCH 1978, FRI 1956)
- **Etymology blocks** where applicable (Nirukta where Indian, comparative where Western)
- **Cross-references** to other CDSL dicts (lemma-linking)
- Digital-first (web + mobile + print); open data (CC-BY-SA 4.0)

### 4.2 Methodology (drawn from this entire research stream)

1. Use **sanhw1** as canonical lemma list (~470k SLP1 forms → ~150k canonical lemmas after normalisation) → select top ~50k by frequency
2. For each lemma, extract glosses from all CDSL Skt-Eng / Skt-Ger / Skt-Fra dicts
3. Machine-translate English/German/French → Russian, validate against KOW/KNA/KCH/FRI
4. Calibrate frequency from a Sanskrit corpus
5. Curate citations from CDSL's cited literature
6. Format per the practical manual (Book #2)

### 4.3 Target

| Item | Value |
|---|---|
| Year | 2035 |
| Working title | TBD (suggestion: *Санскритско-русский словарь нового поколения* / *A new generation Sanskrit-Russian dictionary*) |
| Headword count | ~50,000 |
| Languages | Sanskrit (source) → Russian (target) |
| Format | Digital primary (web + mobile + JSON/SQLite), print companion |
| License | CC-BY-SA 4.0 (data), GPL-3.0 (tooling) |
| Publisher | Russian academic press + open-access digital edition |
| Audience | Russian Sanskritists, students, public |

- 2030: Methodology design, prototype for letter `a-` (5-10k headwords)
- 2031-2032: Scale to 20k headwords across multiple letters
- 2033-2034: Complete the 50k entries
- 2035: Editorial review, publication, defense

## 5. DH + Digital Lexicography trends tracking

Per author request: help track trends in **(a) Digital Humanities** and **(b) Digital Lexicography**. Classical lexicography manuals will be provided as .txt by author for separate analysis (handled in the practical manual workstream, §3 above).

### 5.1 What I (Claude) can produce

| Cadence | Output | Where |
|---|---|---|
| **Monthly** | Bibliography curation: `data/dh_lexicography_bibliography.csv` updated with ~20-40 new papers per month, tagged by category and relevance | `data/` |
| **Quarterly** | Trend digest: tiered (top-20 + appendix), with implications-for-our-research section | `docs/trends/YYYY-QN.md` |
| **Annually** | Briefing document: ~10 pages, December each year, synthesising the trends + their implications for the dissertation + book + dictionary | `docs/trends/YYYY-annual.md` |
| **Quarterly** | Conference watch list: upcoming CFP dates and relevance | `docs/trends/YYYY-QN.md` (last section) |

### 5.2 What I CAN'T directly do (requires M. Gasūns)

- **Read classical lexicography manuals** (Hartmann & James 2001; Wiegand 1989-2017; Atkins & Rundell 2008; Apresjan; Karaulov; Geeraerts) — to be provided as .txt by author
- **Travel-conferenced reports** — only Claude reads, doesn't attend
- **Networking** with active researchers — your domain
- **Editorial / political reads** of journal-policy shifts — needs human judgement

### 5.3 Trend categories to track

| Category | Examples |
|---|---|
| **Standards** | TEI Lex-0, OntoLex-Lemon, LMF (ISO 24613) |
| **Infrastructure** | ELEXIS, CLARIN, DARIAH, OpenAIRE |
| **Methods** | computational stemmatics, phylogenetic methods in textual scholarship, LLM applications |
| **Open data** | Wikidata lexemes, BabelNet, ConceptNet, OmegaWiki |
| **Crowdsourcing** | Wiktionary growth metrics, citizen-lexicographer platforms |
| **AI / NLP** | sense embedding, headword disambiguation, automated dictionary creation |
| **Reproducibility** | snapshot strategies, version control for dictionaries, citation systems |
| **Sanskrit-specific** | GRETIL, DCS, Heritage Hub, Sanskrit Heritage Reader, OpenSanskrit |
| **Russian DH** | Compreno, Russian NLP corpora, Russian lexicography (RAS) |

### 5.4 Action items

1. **Now**: set up tracking infrastructure (Google Scholar alerts, arXiv RSS, conference calendar)
2. **Quarterly**: produce digest (Q1, Q2, Q3, Q4 each year)
3. **Annually**: produce briefing document (December)
4. **When you provide manuals**: ingest the .txt manuals, build `data/lexicography_principles.csv` mapping classical principles to digital implementations

## 6. Research questions

This section is **open for additions** — please list research questions you want included in the publication plan.

### 6.1 Confirmed (already in article schedule)

- Article 1: How do you measure a 170-year-old volunteer-driven lexicography project?
- Article 2: Which dictionaries inherit lemmata from which others, empirically?
- Article 3: Can computational stemmatics reconstruct CDSL's genealogy?
- Article 4: What is Wilson's Nirukta etymology and what Pāṇinian concepts does it use?
- Article 5: Did Monier-Williams (1899) inherit from Bopp (1847) — and how can we test it without direct citation?
- Article 6: What are the three Sanskrit-Russian dictionary traditions and how do they relate?
- Article 7: Why does MW receive disproportionate digital investment — and can we prove it?
- Article 8: How can we typologise data-richness in digital lexicography (L0-L10)?
- Article 9: What is the verb-derivation matrix across 35 dictionaries — and what does it reveal about completeness?
- Article 10: How does samāsa (compound) coverage differ between 19th-century and 20th-century dictionaries?
- Article 11: Is KOW (Kossovich 1854) a Russian translation of WIL (1832) — and what is the forensic evidence?
- Article 12: What are the citation networks in 19th-century Sanskrit lexicography — which texts are most-cited, by whom, when?
- Article 13: How do specialised dictionaries (Vedic, Buddhist, Mahābhārata) differ from general dictionaries in coverage and structure?
- Article 14: What is the Sanskrit-Russian dictionary tradition and how should a new corpus-based dictionary build on it?
- Article 15: What are the principles and prototype for a new corpus-based Sanskrit-Russian dictionary?

### 6.2 Additional research questions (captured 2026-05-16, prompting round 2)

Four publication-strategy and methodology questions surfaced via `AskUserQuestion` and answered by M. Gasūns. Each becomes a new article, comparison study, or named research thread as noted.

**Q5. Additional paper topics beyond the 15 already scheduled** — *all four selected*
- **Article 16: PWG as the European-Sanskrit backbone** — documents PWG → MW72, PWG → SHS, PWG → CCS, and the wider European tradition. Builds directly on the Round-1 lineage answers in [MICROSTRUCTURE-MACROSTRUCTURE §5.2](MICROSTRUCTURE-MACROSTRUCTURE.md#52-new--added-by-author-captured-2026-05-16-prompting-round-1).
- **Article 17: Hapax-legomena-as-copying-evidence — a forensic method** — methodology paper establishing rare-word overlap as the primary forensic instrument for derivation claims. Foundational for Articles 2, 3, 11, 16, 19.
- **Article 18: Grammatical-info coding variation across CDSL** — inventory of how gender, paradigm, and root-class are recorded per dict; ties to the 24 verb-entry + 10 nominal dimensions. Feeds the grammatical-metadata subsystem of the new Skt-Rus dictionary (Article 15).
- **Article 19: The Cappeller-to-Kochergina edge (CCS → KCH)** — standalone treatment of this cross-language, cross-century inheritance. Surprising enough to merit its own paper rather than a subsection of Article 11.
- **Article 20: Two axes of descent — separating content-inheritance from convention-inheritance** *(added 2026-06-03, decision "both")* — standalone DH-methods note from Phase L0/L0.7: the convention fingerprint (Patel 2016 gold) + the **content↔convention reformatting residual** as a reusable instrument for any corpus of related editions. Empirical core: MW absorbed PWG's lexicon (89–94% sanhw1 containment) but recoded its conventions (PWG→MW convention-bootstrap 0.02 vs formatting edges 0.70–0.81). Reuses the same result as **Paper H §5** ([`articles/paper_H_convention_vs_content_lineage.md`](articles/paper_H_convention_vs_content_lineage.md)). Venue: DSH / *Journal of Cultural Analytics*.

**Q6. Comparison studies with non-CDSL Sanskrit projects to formalise** — *all selected, with refinements from M.G.*
- **Sanskrit Heritage (G. Huet)** — bundle with Hyderabad (Amba Kulkarni) as one combined thread; the two share coding lineage.
- **DCS (Digital Corpus of Sanskrit, O. Hellwig)** — used *instead of* pure GRETIL ("DCS is an advanced GRETIL"). Corpus-attestation reality check for CDSL headwords.
- **Hyderabad (Amba Kulkarni)** — bundled with Sanskrit Heritage above.
- **Pandanus (Prague)** — included as one more non-CDSL Sanskrit comparison target. M.G. notes: not yet familiar with this project. **TODO**: produce a one-page brief on Pandanus's scope/status before scoping the comparison study.

**Q7. Methodological questions to test explicitly in dedicated article sections**
- **Distance-metric choice (Jaccard vs. Bray-Curtis vs. Hamming)** — requires an explicit comparison section in Article 3 (computational stemmatics). Particularly important given dict-size asymmetry (WIL ~35k vs. MW ~165k entries) — Jaccard penalises large/small overlaps differently than Bray-Curtis. Bootstrap stability across distance choices should be reported.

**Q8. Russian-tradition / IVRAN research thread**
- **The Petersburg school as a Russian, not just German, institutional tradition** — re-frame Böhtlingk, Roth, Kossovich, and Minayeff as a Russian-institutional lineage, not "German Sanskritists who happened to live in Russia". Coherent with MICROSTRUCTURE §5.2 Q4 (Petersburg lexicographer thread) and Q1 (PWG-as-backbone). Becomes a **named research thread** (Petersburg Thread), not merely a section of Article 6. Threads into Articles 6, 11, 14, 16, 19.

### 6.3 Further questions — open for input

Templates for any additional research questions:

- *"Article N: How does X feature in Y dict family compare to Z feature in W dict family?"*
- *"Article N: Is hypothesis H about CDSL supported by signal S?"*
- *"Article N: What is the relationship between [structural dimension] and [historical fact]?"*

Each additional question becomes one of:
- A new article in the schedule (potentially shifting the timeline)
- A book chapter
- A dashboard chart
- A new phase in the lexicography roadmap

---

## 7. Open questions (next round)

1. **Russian co-authors**: who would you invite as named co-author on the Russian-language articles (4, 6, 11, 14, 15)?
2. **Funding strategy**: is the work entirely unfunded, or is there RSCI / RNF / similar funding to pursue?
3. **Dictionary working title**: any preferred Russian title for the planned Skt-Rus dictionary (Article 15 + Chapter 14 + the dictionary itself)?
4. **Article 1 timing**: should we start drafting now with current data, or wait for L0 / M1 to complete? (Methods draft already created at [`docs/articles/article_1_methods.md`](articles/article_1_methods.md).)
5. **Manual scope**: is the practical manual aimed at academics, or also at independent / amateur lexicographers (Wikipedians, OpenSanskrit contributors)?
6. **Defense timing**: do you have a target year for the higher-doctorate defense (2034? 2035?), affecting whether to compress or expand the 15-article schedule?
